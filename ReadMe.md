## Overview :notebook_with_decorative_cover

 I create a Simple Merchant service using Cuvva CRPC library to explore the awesome library created by the Team in Cuvva.
 I like the simplicity of the library and how easy it is to get started.
 I would appreciate any feedback on the code base, Thanks.

## Installation and running server :gear

- Clone the repo to your local machine using your _terminal_ or _command prompt_, and afterwards, navigate into the root folder  

```shell script
cd cuvva-sample-code
```

- Run this command to create a database

```shell script
make createdb
```

- Run the code

```shell script
go run main.go
```

- to run the client cd to the client folder

```shell script
go run *go
```

Thanks
